<h1> JOURNEY  </h1>


<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> I started by journey as being "fat to fit " in 2008 and eventually reduced 30 kgs by modifying my lifestyle, dietary pattern. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> The main change in my life was asoption of yogic techniques and asanas. However, during that time I suffered from Cervical spondylitis and it was surprised because I was already doing suryanamaskar and other asanas, which were said to give only benefits . This made me read books on yoga and study the science of health in a deeper way. That's when I was introduced to real philosophy of yoga and correct way of doing postures/ practice.  </p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> With deep interest to develop myself and help others, I studied at Yoga niketan Vadodara. I did  months YTTC From there and started my journey from home to teach yog in it real essence . My first batch was 5 people and within a month, grew to 20 people. I increased the number of batches and started personal trainings too.  </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> Along with taking classes I studied more n more in yogic science by doing various courses from MYSORE, HRISHIKESH AND AHEMEDABAD. Having more than 10years of experience and touching more than 1000 lives by taking regular yoga classes, corporate workshop and various workshops ( name few workshops here ). </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> By Appying YOGIC SCIENCE , SOUND THERAPHY AND AYURVEDA CONCEPTS were able to help people control and cure conditions like diabetes, thyroid, hypertention, depression, anxiety and various stress and lifestyle related issue.  </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> Today having client base all over India and abroad taking classes online and having my center for wellness in the name of yog with Meeta. </p>
