<p> The very crux of Yogic discipline is establishing mind and body balance. Imagine walking into office feeling exhausted and grumpy every day with your team feeling the same – thanks to long working hours that leaves employees low on mental and physical energy.   </p>

<p> The holistic approach of Yoga helps in boosting a person’s well-being and personal growth.   </p>

<p> Being healthy mentally and physically is of utmost importance to be able to blossom fully. </p>
<p> Hence, <strong> Corporate Yoga</strong> encompasses the concept of working with peace while also managing a hectic environment. The purpose of office Yoga is not limited to stretching and asanas, however its primal objective is to relax and calm oneself.  </p>

Like a flower bud, human life has the potential to blossom fully. Blossoming of human potential to fullness is Yoga. </p>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">
<p style="    margin-bottom: 8px;"> <strong>1. Improving Posture </strong> </p>
<p> Sitting for longer hours with hunched backs, staring at computer causes unnatural damages to your health such as back pain and neck pain (quite common for office-goers). Stretching every once in a while with the help of Yoga postures can help relieve this pain and restore your posture.  </p>
</div>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">
<p style="    margin-bottom: 8px;"> <strong> 2. Immunity Booster  </strong> </p>
<p>  
Being physically fit may not necessarily mean that your immune system is healthy. Vague working hours also lead to longer hours of fasting or eating junk food. In this case, Yoga necessarily aids in blood circulation in our body and mind that reduces stress, aches and pains. Hence, healthy employees lead to less sick leaves.  </p>
</div>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">
<p style="    margin-bottom: 8px;"> <strong>3. Focus better </strong> </p>
<p>  Stressful work-life balance induces a mental clutter that cloud over a person’s decision making skills, leading to less concentration power.   </p>
<p> In such cases, dhyana, that is, meditation rescues the mind from cluttering and helps in keeping the mind more still, focused and alert while making decisions. </p>
</div>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">
<p style="    margin-bottom: 8px;"> <strong> 4. Inducing Creativity </strong> </p>
<p> 
Yoga is proved to increase focus and concentration whilst making employees more productive. Therefore, the regular practice of Yoga not only helps employees in being happy but also helps them be innovative in their approach towards work by broadening their creative expressions.   </p>
</div>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">
<p style="    margin-bottom: 8px;"> <strong> 5. Reduced Stress and Irritability </strong> </p>
<p>  Longer work hours, unreasonable deadlines and work pressure induces stress and irritability in employees. This leads to decreased productivity and unhappy workforce. Many organizations have time and again face the ill effects of stress in monetary terms.  </p>

<p> Incorporating Yoga in employees’ lifestyles has shown to keeping a calm mind with the help of asana, pranayama, and dhyana. A stress-free mind combats anger, disputes, irritability while inducing a positive outlook in life.  </p>
</div>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">
<p style="    margin-bottom: 8px;"> <strong> 6. Confidence and Morale Boost </strong> </p>
<p> Physical and mental fitness is vital to be able to have a confident person at work. The aspect of office Yoga focuses on poses and techniques that improves flexibility and muscle strength. This increase in flexibility boosts a person’s confidence that gradually reflects in all aspects of their life.  </p>
<p> Similarly, stressful situations that cause frustration and anger can be reduced by elevating the practice of Yoga. Stress reduction means keeping the cortisol hormone at bay, hence keeping employees motivated and foster a healthy workforce. </p>
