<p> The process of meditation is also referred to as dhyana in Sanskrit, where the goal is quieting the mind to attain an inner state of awareness and intensify personal and spiritual well-being.  </p>

<p> According to Bhagavad Gita, the practice of mediation is acceptance of the world – some use it to follow the path of Karma, some to offer devotion the parmatama and some for other reasons – Lord Krishna suggests all these reasons converge to one thing – the absolute truth. More so, meditation according to The Gita teaches us how looking within frees us from hope and possession of the reality and lets us balance out the right and wrong in a better way.  </p>


<div style="padding: 20px 20px 10px 25px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 1px dotted #ff8000;" class="call-action call-action-boxed call-action-style1 clearfix"> 
<p style="    margin-bottom: 6px; font-style: italic"> 
Whenever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self.  Abiding joy comes to those who still the mind.  Freeing themselves from the taint of self-will, with their consciousness unified, they become one with Brahman.  </p>

<p style="    margin-bottom: 6px; font-style: italic; text-align: right"> 
~ The Bhagavad Gita </p>

</div>


<p>
Our mind is an implementation of awareness that links us to the world outside to let us have an inner experience. The mind serves as a bridge to out conscious self. While meditating, one’s conscious mind is quieted and focused and abandon the outer world. This opens gates of the subconscious – inner witness or memory that is unknowingly retained from daily experiences. Meditation can alter brain waves and hence through this focusing and guided meditation can implement changes in our subconscious to heal our mental and physical problems. 
</p>


<p>
Therefore, practice of meditation involves having to concentrated or focus on either a <strong>sound</strong> (mantra, music or phrase), <strong>visualizing</strong> (imagining an object like a flower or our chakras with eyes closed), <strong>gazing</strong> (actually looking at an object with open eyes), and <strong>breathing</strong> (observing breathing patterns, where and how it travels in the body).
 </p>


<p> Meditation is therapeutic in nature. Through guided and unguided techniques, we at Yog with Meeta devise special meditation sessions to help seekers reach a particular goal. From healing ailments to reducing mental stress, meditation programs at Yog with Meeta allows one to gain insight into their inner self and heal issues within to feel heal outside.  </p>
