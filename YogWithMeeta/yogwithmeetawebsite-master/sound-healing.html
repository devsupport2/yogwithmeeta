<div class="pro-content clearfix">

<p> Have you ever sat by the beach and let the sounds of the ocean waves and wind calm your senses? Or how on waking up early on a morning and hearing the chirping of birds?  Sound and music existing in nature give us more than just a soothing feeling.  </p>

<p> Therapists and Yogis use this soothing feeling of sound and music to cure or relax mind-body imbalances in people. This therapy is popularly known as Sound Healing. Healing by sound is a practice that uses vibrations to relax mental and physical stress. <strong>Sound healing</strong> has been used in various cultures for meditation, ailment healing and stress relief.   </p>


<p> Human body, which is made up of 70% water, functions at certain vibrations that can be manipulated by sound waves. Scientifically, sound healing uses resonance to harmonize sound and brain waves to restore a person’s normal vibratory frequencies of body cells. </p>

<p> Sound healing can be used with various instruments such as gongs, voice, drums, however the most popular instrument is the Tibetan ‘singing bowls’ that have been used by monks and yogis for centuries.  </p>


<p> While Tibetan bowls bring about a strengthened vibratory coherence within human mind and body with its 7 sacred metal alloy of gold, silver, iron, mercury, tin, copper, and lead, these bowls are also used to <strong>clearing the chakras</strong>. Balancing or clearing of the seven chakras – root, scaral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye and crown – is when every chakra, or energy center, responds to various frequencies. These chakras resonate to sound of induced by Tibetan bowls.  </p>
