The most harmful force known to humanity is raw anger that causes physical, mental, emotional and social problems. But to be able to control, manage and conquer that anger, is winning the biggest battle of life. </p>

<p> Anger is defined as ‘an intense emotional state involving a strong feeling of displeasure, annoyance, or hostility in response to the perceived provocation.’ This form of anger is healthy until you’re able to hit the delete button. However, it is ‘the most harmful force’ when it induces stress that causes high blood pressure, heart rate, increased breathing rate, and stress levels.  </p>

<p> The Anger and <strong>Stress management</strong> program at Yog with Meeta focus on balancing the balance of mind and body of a person. Imbalances in anger and stress cause ill-effects such as heart attack, stroke, decreased immunity, skin problems, insomnia, digestive problems, heart problems, anxiety, depression, migraines, and complications in pre-existing health conditions. </p>

<p> Supressing your anger may not always help, rather to be able to control and calm yourself is highly recommended with the help of Yoga. Yoga undoubtedly helps in channelling your anger towards something constructive such as love and compassion, therefore reducing stress and finding peace.  </p>

‘The first drawback of anger is that it destroys your inner peace: the second is that it distorts your view of reality. If you think about this and come to understand that anger is really unhelpful, that it is only destructive,  then you can begin to distance yourself from anger’</p>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">
<p> Yogic therapies to manage anger and stress have passed the test of time with the mind-body-energy concepts. Various asanas, pranayama and meditation work as a toolkit to free up obstructions on physical, mental or energetic levels. <strong style="font-style: italic">“Asanas allow you to move the energy”</strong> suggests Stephen Cope who believes Yoga is the best antidote for anger and stress. </p>

<p> One of the techniques for coping with anger is mindfulness – a state where one is more aware and paying attention to thoughts, feelings, and behaviours of themselves and others around them. At Yog with Meeta, we believe anger and compassion to be two sides of a coin. Hence, we use the practice of mindfulness to channelize and draw the energy caused by anger, also known as anger triggers and impulses, and turn it into love and compassion in order to control the regular outburst. This particularly helps one in the long run as one learns to practice empathy more often than being angry in the smallest of situations. </p>

<p> Regular practice of Yoga intertwined with the practice of mindfulness reduces cortisol levels induced by stress caused by work, relationships, and anger, while restoring harmony in your mind-body balances.  </p>
