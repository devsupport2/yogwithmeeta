<h4> What is yoga  therapy?  </h4>
<p> although all yoga is potentially therapeutic and healing, yoga therapy is the specific application of yogic tools—postures/exercises, breathwork, meditation techniques, and more—to address an individual’s physical, mental, and emotional needs. </p>
</div>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">

<li> Movement ranging from gentle to vigorous </li>
<li> Breathing techniques </li>
<li> Meditation or visualization practices </li>
<li> Physical postures that address specific areas of discomfort or musculoskeletal imbalances </li>
<li> Various self realization techniques.  </li>

<h4> How does yoga therapy help?  </h4>
<p> We meet you as an where you are, connecting with you to make you understand your own innate healing potential. Yoga therapy clients report experiencing improved mood, decreased stress and chronic pain, and better living experience.   </p>
<p> One mechanism researchers have uncovered is yoga’s capacity to affect the nervous system by improving our ability to self-regulate. </p>
<p>  The practice uses methods that work via both the mind and the body, known in research as top-down and bottom-up regulation. Put simply, top-down regulation uses cognitive tools like meditation and ethical inquiry to affect the state of the body, whereas bottom-up regulation uses the body itself, through movement and breathing techniques, to change the state of the nervous system and to affect thoughts and emotions. </p>
<p> In short, the practice of yoga equips us with a comprehensive tool kit to help support regulation and resilience in the mind-body system. Yoga therapy is the specific use of these tools by a trained practitioner. </p>
