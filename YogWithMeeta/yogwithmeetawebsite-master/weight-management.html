<p> The journey of losing weight begins with your idea of having an ‘ideal’ or a ‘perfect body’.  </p>

<p> When you decide to make shed those extra kilos, you decide with your mind and heart. The idea of a ‘perfect body’ exists in our mind more so than just hitting the gym and working out every day. Weight management is a journey, not a short cut. </p>

<p>
The path to achieving something in life arises the moment the trigger points in your mind are activated. A human being’s mind and body is layered into different personalities that lead to alter their mind-set. 
</p>


<p>
One of the most ancient conceptualizations of a human being’s personality comes from the theory of Pancha Kosha. The theory of Pancha Kosha was first described in the Taittiriya Upanishad. It describes that a human being is said to have five sheaths or layered personality.
 </p>

</div>

<div class="pro-content clearfix">
<h4> The term ‘Pancha Kosha’ is derived from the Sanskrit word pancha, meaning ‘five’ and kosha, meaning ‘sheath’. The five sheaths of human soul consists: </h4>

<li> <strong> Annamaya kosha </strong> – the food sheath: the physical body that requires food and nourishment to thrive.  </li>
<li> <strong> Pranamaya kosha </strong>– the breath sheath: exists within the physical body and flows in the circulatory, lymphatic and nervous systems. </li>
<li> <strong>Manomaya kosha</strong> – the mind sheath: governs perception of the world and develops a sense of the Self.   </li>
<li> <strong> Vijnanamaya kosha</strong> – the intellect sheath: the conscious layer that governs the sense of morals and ethics that are responsible for inner growth and gaining knowledge. </li>
<li> <strong> Anandamaya kosha </strong> – the bliss sheath: uniting all the koshas and experiencing unity with consciousness deeper than the materialistic world.  </li>

<p> The weight management program in Yog with Meeta operates on the philosophy of ‘Pancha Kosha’ that aims to begin a journey inward. Unlike other weight loss programs and techniques, the model of Pancha Kosha allows you to understand your inner self and uncover your true nature. For instance, with the help of Annamaya kosha, you understand that the physical body needs food and nourishment to thrive. Imbalances in this layer affects all other layers in our body, hence it is said that if one gets ‘stuck’ in this layer, then they become obsessive about the outer form. Therefore, when you simply focus on ‘losing fat’ you get stuck in the Annamaya Kosha.    </p>
</p>

<p> The holistic approach of Pancha Kosha is deliberated on a human being’s overall growth – starting from eating right to breathing right to thinking right, hence making one a healthy person leading a healthy life. Yog with Meeta’s weight loss program changes your perception of a perfect body with various techniques such as asanas, weight loss meditation and the likes. With this course, you not only attain a certain body weight but you learn to maintain it in order to pursue a healthy lifestyle.  </p>

<p> Along with that, applying techniques of Pancha Kosha in Yoga, we make sure your system undergoes an entire rejuvenation – that is deeper that just your physical body. Therefore, practicing asanas, kriyas and other forms of Yoga, naturally fine tune your Aatman (inner self) to control and regulate your physical body.  </p>
