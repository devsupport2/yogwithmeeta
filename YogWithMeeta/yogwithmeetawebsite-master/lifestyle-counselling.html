<p> “I follow a regular diet”, “You should regularly exercise – go to the gym”, “If you want a better lifestyle, you should start eating your greens and stop all the cheese!”   </p>

<p> All of the above sentences lead to nowhere but self-doubt and hard-work gone to waste. All our lifestyles are always under the making – not matter how many days you fast or how many calories you burn. Healthy lifestyle is looking deeper into the self to attain the ideal way of life.  </p>

<p>A lifestyle is inclusive of nutrition, exercise, mental and physical health. At Yog with Meeta, we intertwine the beauty of counselling, that is, psychotherapy, and Yoga therapy to guide individualistic needs, goals and lifestyle of the seeker and help him/her lead a better life.  </p>

<p> Counselling is a therapeutic discipline that deals with identifying problematic thoughts or behaviour pattern to improve emotional balance. It aids in developing new skills, procession difficult emotions and finding and healing the root cause of problems such as depression, anxiety, addictions, emotional dependency, anger, trauma, PTSD, chronic stress, etc.  </p>

<p> Counselling weaved with the teachings of Yoga therapy is a sustainable means of bettering at life. The concepts, principles and techniques of Yoga are modified from person to person that brings out its therapeutic effect an individual is seeking. From physical injuries to health concerns and conditions, Yoga therapy restores greater health throughout the course of an individual’s Lifestyle Counselling.   </p>

<p> While group sessions of Yoga guide you through different asanas, stretching, breathing, and techniques to improve your overall posture, strength that relax and reenergize you, lifestyle counselling adheres to apply the science of Yoga and psychotherapy on an individual basis. This aids in improving the seeker’s medical conditions and supports the healing process of the aatma, or the inner self. </p>

<p> With no side effects, Yoga therapy and lifestyle counselling can be done at any stage of life. Hence, it holds importance for children, adults and senior citizens as it provides the knowledge required to live a balanced lifestyle.  </p>
