<div class="text"> The very crux of Yogic discipline is establishing mind and body balance. Imagine walking into office feeling exhausted and grumpy every day; with your team feeling the same – thanks to long working hours that leaves employees low on mental and physical energy.   </div>
<div class="text"> The holistic approach of Yoga helps in boosting a person’s well-being and personal growth. Being healthy mentally and physically is of utmost importance to be able to blossom fully. Hence, <strong>Corporate Yoga</strong> encompasses the concept of working with peace while also managing a hectic environment. The purpose of office Yoga is not limited to stretching and performing asanas, however its primal objective is to relax and calm oneself.   </div>

<div class="sec-title">
<div class="text">  Sitting for longer hours with hunched backs, staring at computer causes unnatural damages to your health such as back pain and neck pain (quite common for office-goers). Stretching every once in a while with the help of Yoga postures can help relieve this pain and restore your posture.  </div>

2. Immunity Booster  
</h2>
<div class="sec-title">
<div class="text"> Being physically fit may not necessarily mean that your immune system is healthy. Vague working hours also lead to longer hours of fasting or eating junk food. In this case, Yoga necessarily aids in blood circulation in our body and mind that reduces stress, aches and pains. Hence, healthy employees lead to less sick leaves. </div>

3. Focus better 
</h2>
<div class="sec-title">
<div class="text"> Stressful work-life balance induces a mental clutter that cloud over a person’s decision making skills, leading to less concentration power. <br>
In such cases, dhyana, that is, meditation rescues the mind from cluttering and helps in keeping the mind more still, focused and alert while making decisions. </div>

5. Reduced Stress and Irritability

<div class="sec-title">
<div class="text"> Longer work hours, unreasonable deadlines and work pressure induces stress and irritability in employees. This leads to decreased productivity and unhappy workforce. Many organizations have time and again face the ill effects of stress in monetary terms. <br>
Incorporating Yoga in employees’ lifestyles has shown to keeping a calm mind with the help of asana, pranayama, and dhyana. A stress-free mind combats anger, disputes, irritability while inducing a positive outlook in life.  </div>
